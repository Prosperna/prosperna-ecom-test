# React Test

## Objective:
Develop a comprehensive e-commerce application using ReactJS, showcasing your proficiency in building dynamic and interactive web interfaces. Your project should emphasize the creation of reusable components, the utilization of helper functions and partials, and the implementation of custom hooks. Additionally, the application must include a suite of unit tests using either Mocha or Jest, ensuring the reliability and maintainability of the code.
## Key Features:
1. Reusable Components: Design modular and reusable components that can be utilized across various parts of the application. This includes elements like product cards, navigation bars, form controls, and any other common interface elements.

2. Helper Functions and Partials: Implement helper functions and partials to manage common tasks such as data formatting, API calls, or state management routines. This approach promotes code cleanliness and reduces redundancy.

3. Custom Hooks: Develop custom React hooks to encapsulate component logic, making it more readable and reusable. These hooks could manage state, handle side effects, or interact with external data sources.

4. Unit Testing: Write comprehensive unit tests for your components, hooks, and helper functions using Mocha or Jest. Ensure that tests cover key functionalities and edge cases, demonstrating the reliability of your application.
